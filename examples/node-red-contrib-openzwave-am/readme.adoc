You need to understand ZWave basics.
And make sure the USB stick and devices are correctly paired.
Check low-level info at link:https://github.com/kalemena/iot-tools/tree/master/docs/gateways/zwave[]

== How-To

IMPORTANT: ZWave libraries are installed into this Node-RED Docker image already.

Here is how to run the ZWave in Node-RED:

* Edit *docker-compose.yml* to set you USB ZWave key (e.g. /dev/ttyZWave)
* Start environment as explained below
* Browse link:http://localhost:1880[]
* Change input nodes to set ids of your ZWave devices (e.g. my switch is 7 in this sample)
* Click the *switchOn* or *switchOff* button !
